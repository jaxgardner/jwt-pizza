Different Cloud Vendors for DevOps

**Google Cloud**
- Third largest cloud provider in the world.
- Provides VM instances and serverless solutions similar to AWS Lambda.
- Does not have as many data centers as AWS and Azure, but Google is quite good at network optimization, so generally not a big problem.
- Offers a pay as you use system, similar to AWS. (Locking into a contract for several years can lower the price)
- A good choice if working with data management and analytics. 
- Has access to the Google Fiber network, which is considered very fast so lower latency is expected.
- Provides a very detailed cost analysis upfront, unlike AWS which may have some surprise costs.

**Microsoft Azure**
- Is the second biggest market leader in cloud computing.
- Designed to work well with Windows computing.
- Provides VM instances and serverless solutions similar to AWS Lambda.
- Has an extensive data center network comparable to AWS.
- Also offers a pay as you go system.
- An excellent choice if there is a strong emphasis on security. Is known for a high security system and good integration with in-house Microsoft products. 
- Is geared for hybrid systems which means having inhouse data centers that work with the cloud. 

**Digital Ocean**
- Does not offer as many services as AWS, Azure, or Google cloud, but claims a developer friendly system.
- Is cheaper than the other cloud vendors and offers a more transparent cost analysis.
- Uses a simpler UI so that startup companies can get off of the ground faster.
- Products include load balancers, kubernetes, docker images, databases and many other basic services most companies would use.


Overall differences:  

  The big three cloud vendors offer very similar products, each has their own solution to problems like virtual machines, load balancers, databases etc. There are some notable differences however, AWS is a more mature system and offers the most products. AWS has specific offerings for game development, robotics, and end-user computing. Azure is starting to catch up in these fields, but Google Cloud doesnâ€™t have specific products for these things. Cost is also something to look at, Azure tends to be the cheapest enterprise solution with AWS behind it. Google Cloud does offer a free $300 credit when first joining which is much better than the other two vendors. When looking at using the system AWS may be considered overwhelming due to the amount of products it offers. At the same time it has been around the longest so there is a large amount of community support and guides. Comparatively Azure and Google Cloud are younger with less users so it may be a little harder to find information. Azure works really well integrating with Windows products, but it is designed with Enterprise companies first, so some solutions may seem overly complex for smaller companies. Google Cloud could be considered the most user friendly for smaller companies and have different levels of customer support that can be used. On top of these three larger ecosystems there are smaller cloud vendors that may offer cheaper and more simpler solutions for startup companies. Some examples include DigitalOcean or Hetzner. These types of vendors offer less solutions, but have the most necessary ones at cheaper costs. They may be a better choice for developers trying to get a product off of the ground. At the end of the day it seems like each one is very similar and it comes down to a developer or companies preference of which system they would like to work with. I do find AWS slightly overwhelming and have done some work with DigitalOcean which was much simpler.
